# Building Modern Websites with Next.js

At Spaarke, we chose Next.js as the foundation for our web platform. Here is why it has been a great fit and how we approach modern web development.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js gives us the best of both worlds: the rich interactivity of React with the performance benefits of server-side rendering and static generation. Key advantages include:

- **App Router** - The new app directory structure makes layouts, loading states, and error boundaries intuitive.
- **Server Components** - Render on the server by default, sending less JavaScript to the browser.
- **Built-in Optimizations** - Image optimization, font loading, and code splitting come out of the box.

## Our Tech Stack

We pair Next.js with a handful of carefully chosen tools:

- **TypeScript** for type safety across the entire codebase
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for utility-first styling with zero runtime cost
- **MDX** for content-driven pages like this blog

## A Quick Example

Here is a simplified version of how we fetch and render blog posts using server components:

```typescript
import { getAllPosts } from "@/lib/blog";

export default function BlogIndex() {
  const posts = getAllPosts();

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.slug}>
          <a href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

The beauty of this approach is that the component runs entirely on the server. No client-side JavaScript is needed just to display a list of posts.

## What Is Next

We are continuously improving our stack and will share more technical deep-dives in future posts. Topics on the horizon include image optimization strategies, MDX customization, and deploying to the edge.

Stay tuned and happy building!
